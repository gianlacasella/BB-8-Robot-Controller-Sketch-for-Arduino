# BB-8 Robot  Controller Sketch for  Arduino

An Arduino Sketch created to control a BB-8 robot, for a project at Universidad de los Andes. My team used Bluetooth
and the "Arduino Bluetooth RC Car" app on an Android phone to control the robot. The BB-8 was able to move in 8 directions,
and play Star Wars sounds through a buzzer. 

We used two engines connected to the LN-298N controller, the HC-06 Bluethoot module, a switch and 18 AA batteries.

In this folder you can find the schematic, the code in .cpp  and in /arduinoBB8 the .ino file.


# What I learned

* Programming an Arduino using Arduino IDE (pinMode, setup, loop function, digital and analog write and their differences)
* Play sounds and melodies through a buzzer
* Manage Bluetooth communication with an Android app on Arduino
