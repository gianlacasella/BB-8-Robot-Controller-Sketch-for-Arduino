# BB-8 Robot  Controller Sketch for  Arduino

An Arduino Sketch created to control a BB-8 robot, for a project at Universidad de los Andes. My team used Bluetooth
and the "Arduino Bluetooth RC Car" app on an Android phone to control the robot. The BB-8 was able to move in 8 directions,
and play Star Wars sounds through a buzzer. 

We used two engines connected to the LN-298N controller, the HC-06 Bluethoot module, a switch and 18 AA batteries.

## Getting Started

First of all, clone or download this repository, and assemble the circuit accordingly to the schematic below.  
![Schematic](/img/schematic.jpg)


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
